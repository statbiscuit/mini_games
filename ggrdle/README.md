## Changes and New Features

### Key Features
- **Dynamic Word Bank Selection**: Players can now choose from different categories (e.g., `statisticalFunction`, `baseRFunctions`, `ggplot2Functions`) to customize their game based on R functions and packages.
- **Interactive Keyboard**: The on-screen keyboard dynamically changes colors (green for correct letters in the right place, yellow for correct letters in the wrong place, gray for incorrect letters) based on the playerâ€™s guesses, similar to the behavior in Wordle.
- **Physical Keyboard Support**: In addition to the on-screen keyboard, the game now supports physical keyboard input, allowing players to type directly using their keyboard.
- **Grid and Keyboard Synchronization**: Both the game grid and the virtual keyboard update together in real-time, reflecting the accuracy of each guess.

### How to Play
1. **Start Game**: Click on "Play" to start the game. You can select different categories to customize the words you'll guess.
2. **Enter Guesses**: Use the on-screen keyboard or your physical keyboard to enter letters.
3. **Check Results**: After each guess, the letters will change colors:
   - **Green**: Correct letter in the right position.
   - **Yellow**: Correct letter in the wrong position.
   - **Gray**: Incorrect letter.
4. **Win or Lose**: The game continues until you either guess the word or run out of attempts (max of 6).

### Additional Notes
- **Custom Word Bank**: You can modify the `words.js` file to include your own set of words, allowing the game to focus on specific R functions, packages, or other topics.
- **Responsive Design**: The game interface has been optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, with adjustments made to the layout and button sizes on smaller screens.

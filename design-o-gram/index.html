    <h2>How to Play Design-o-gram</h2>
    <div class="scrollable-content">
      <p>
        Your goal is to recreate the target grid by toggling cells to match the patterns indicated by the row and column clues.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Click a cell to toggle it on/off.</li>
        <li>The game is won when all rows and columns match their respective clues.</li>
      </ul>
      <hr class="section-divider">
      <h3>Understanding the Clues</h3>
      <p>The numbers outside the grid represent groups of consecutive filled cells:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A **comma-separated hint** (e.g., <strong>3, 2</strong>) means there is at least one empty cell between the groups.
        </li>
        <li>
          A **whitespace-separated hint** (e.g., <strong>1 2</strong>) also means groups are separated by at least one empty cell.
        </li>
        <li>
          A single number (e.g., <strong>5</strong>) represents one continuous group of filled cells.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>Start with rows or columns that have the largest numbers.</li>
        <li>Use the numbers to infer which cells must remain empty.</li>
